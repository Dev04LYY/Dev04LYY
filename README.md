## Hi, I'm Li Yanyang! 👋

I'm a senior undergraduate from the School of Integrated Circuit, Sun Yat-sen University, majoring in Microelectronics Science and Engineering. I discovered my passion for computer architecture during my junior year through the "One Student, One Chip" (一生一芯) program. Although I started later than some, I'm dedicated to advancing my expertise in this field.

**Achievements**:
- 🏆 Led a team to win the National First Prize at the 9th Integrated Circuit Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition (Jingyeda Cup).

**Next Goal**:  
Preparing for the graduate entrance examination in December 2025, with the aim of pursuing further study and research at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS).
